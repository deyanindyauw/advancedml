# Advanced ML
Project code as part of Advanced ML TCSS 556 Spring 2021 course

This repository contains the following :

1. Sample GNN code implementation in Keras - (Reference : https://github.com/aimat-lab/gcnn_keras)

2. Sample GNN code implementation in PyTorch (Reference : https://towardsdatascience.com/program-a-simple-graph-net-in-pytorch-e00b500a642d)

3. Dataset - Yoochooose (Reference : https://www.kaggle.com/chadgostopp/recsys-challenge-2015)

Both #1 and #2 are tested to be running fine with Python 3.8 and Keras 2.4.3 and Torch 1.8.1

TODO : Adapt the above code to run on Yoochoose dataset
